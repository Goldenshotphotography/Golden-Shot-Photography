You are seeing this error because your GitHub account (ChanduGangola06) does not have permission to push to the repository Goldenshotphotography/Golden-Shot-Photography.git. The error message:

```
remote: Permission to Goldenshotphotography/Golden-Shot-Photography.git denied to ChanduGangola06.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Goldenshotphotography/Golden-Shot-Photography.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

means that either:
- You are not a collaborator on the repository.
- You are not authenticated correctly (wrong credentials or token).
- You are trying to push to a repository you do not own or have not been granted write access to.

**How to fix:**

1. **Check your permissions:**
   - Make sure you are a collaborator on the repository. If not, ask the repository owner to add you.

2. **Check your authentication:**
   - If you are using HTTPS, make sure you are using a valid GitHub username and a personal access token (not your password).
   - If you are using SSH, make sure your SSH key is added to your GitHub account.

3. **Check your remote URL:**
   - Run `git remote -v` to see the current remote URL.
   - If you have access via SSH, you can change the remote to use SSH:
     ```
     git remote set-url origin git@
